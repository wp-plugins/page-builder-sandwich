Turn your visual editor into a page builder

== Description ==

= Call it PB Sandwich for short =

One of the most frustrating things when creating content is layouting and writing them inside the visual editor.

Sure you can use **shortcodes columns**, but are not user friendly with all those distracting square brackets. Not to mention that column shortcodes are just displayed as a single column in the visual editor.

Existing **Page builders** are also great, but we didn't want to hijack the content editor and we wanted to find a way to do it using the existing visual editor that everyone knows. Page builders have a ton of code in them for creating brand new interfaces, but more code means more stuff which can go wrong in the future.

*Check out the screenshots to see how Shortcodeless Columns works.*

= What it does =

Extends your visual editor to include page builder capabilities

= The Goal =

The goal is to create a page builder that:

* Feels and acts *native* and part of WordPress
* Leaves *most* of the content working fine event if the plugin is deactivated or deleted
* Lazy, no settings pages specific for the plugin

= What can you do with it =

* Create editable, nestable columns
* Drag and drop TinyMCE views into other locations. Works with:
  * WordPress image galleries,
  * Jetpack video embeds,
  * Jetpack audio embeds,
  * Shortcake
* Clone shortcodes & columns
* Create different shortcodes (no shortcodes are included yet, contributions are welcome at the [Github repository](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/) )
