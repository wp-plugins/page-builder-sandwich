The native visual editor page builder. Empower your visual editor with shortcodes and drag and drop & column capabilities.

== Description ==

Visit our website at [pbsandwi.ch](http://pbsandwi.ch). We now have [awesome extensions](http://pbsandwi.ch/downloads) to further empower your page building experience.

= The page builder that: =

* allows you to visually create columns that actually look like columns,
* enables you to edit margins, paddings, borders and background colors and images of columns and whole rows,
* lets you preview your rendered content and shortcodes from your backend,
* adds page builder capabilities without hijacking your visual editor,
* gives you a nice interface to edit your favorite shortcodes: Jetpack, bbPress, BuddyPress, and plenty more;
* looks & feels native to WordPress,
* just works without any set ups and hassles, and
* you'll forget that you have it turned on since it blends so well with WordPress

*Check out the screenshots to see how PB Sandwich works.*

**Requires PHP 5.3+**

= What can you do with it =

* Content areas with custom background images & colors
* Create editable, nestable columns
* Edit text and content using the TinyMCE visual editor like how you normally would
* Live working preview of embedded content (e.g. put in a YouTube video and you can play it while still being able to drag it)
* Drag and drop TinyMCE views into other locations
* Clone shortcodes/embeds & columns
* Create different shortcodes
* Working undo

= TLDR Intro =

One of the most frustrating things when creating content is layouting and writing them inside the visual editor.

Sure you can use **shortcodes columns**, but are not user friendly with all those distracting square brackets. Not to mention that column shortcodes are just displayed as a single column in the visual editor.

Existing **Page builders** are also great, but we didn't want to hijack the content editor and we wanted to find a way to do it using the existing visual editor that everyone knows. Page builders have a ton of code in them for creating brand new interfaces, but more code means more stuff which can go wrong in the future.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want more features! =

We now have [awesome extensions](http://pbsandwi.ch/downloads) to further empower your page building experience.

= I just installed Sandwich. Where is it? =

Go ahead and edit a post or page using the visual editor. You might not notice it, but your visual editor is now a page builder *(mic drop)*.

= How do I add columns? =

We have added a **column** button in your visual editor (first row of buttons, right-most), click on that to create columns

= How do I add shortcodes? =

Click on **Add Media**, then **Insert Post Element**. Click on one, edit its settings, then hit **insert**. Some shortcodes are only available if you have Jetpack activated.

As of v0.9+, we've added an **Add Post Element** button beside the **Add Media** button for easy access.

= You don't have shortcode _____! I need it! =

*Suggest it to us.* We're thinking of more ways to further expand the capabilities of Sandwich, [suggest it in our Github Repo](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/issues/new)

= Do I need Jetpack installed to make this work? =

*Nope,* although if you have it activated, then additional widgets and shortcodes will become available in Sandwich.

= I'm getting a `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION error` =

Page Builder Sandwich requires PHP 5.3 or higher. Some of the stuff we use require PHP 5.3, so unfortunately we cannot support lower versions.

= WTF, I hate tables! Why are tables used to display columns? =

*Be calm!* Tables are **only** used in the backend / visual editor. In the front end, those tables will be **gone** and will be replaced by good ol' clean divs that use Bootstrap's grid to display your content.

Why did we do it this way? Because table editing is handled pretty well by TinyMCE. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we simply used what TinyMCE already does well and extended that into what we needed.

**So once again, I repeat, no tables are present in the front end.**

= Where can I report bugs? =

You can do so in our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gambitph/Page-Builder-Sandwich/issues)
